# Autocomplete and Spell-Checker using Trie and Edit Distance (C++)

This project implements an **Autocomplete and Spell-Checker** system using a combination of Trie data structure and Edit Distance algorithm in C++. It efficiently stores a dictionary of words, supports prefix-based word suggestions, and provides closest word suggestions when no exact prefix match is found.

## Features

- Efficient word insertion and lookup using Trie.
- Autocomplete suggestions based on prefix input.
- Spell-check and nearest word suggestion using Edit Distance.
- Supports both uppercase and lowercase English alphabets.
- Displays all valid completions for given prefix or suggests the closest word if no match found.

## How It Works

1. **Trie Data Structure:**  
   Stores dictionary words for quick prefix searches. Each node represents a character and tracks word endings.

2. **Autocomplete:**  
   Given a prefix, the Trie is traversed to find all words starting with that prefix, displayed as suggestions.

3. **Spell Correction:**  
   If no words with the given prefix exist, the Edit Distance algorithm calculates the closest word(s) from the dictionary and suggests the best match.

## Usage

1. Compile the code with a C++ compiler supporting C++11 or later:
